# Which path is worth it?

Choosing among approaches under incomplete information is a bandit problem,
and the poker rule applies: never fold on a point estimate, and pay for
information only where the upside is wide.

## Steps

1. List the candidate paths. For each, write down what you know:
   `successes`, `failures` (0 if untried), a `prior` (0.5 if no idea),
   `costPerAttempt` and `valueIfSuccess` in the same unit (tokens, minutes,
   or euros — it only needs to be consistent). Paths that are hostnames need
   no counts; the ledger supplies them.

2. Ask — the `clawphylax_which_path` tool, `/phylax paths <json>`, or:

   ```bash
   openclaw clawphylax paths '[{"name":"official-api","successes":3,"failures":1,"costPerAttempt":1,"valueIfSuccess":10},{"name":"scrape-site","costPerAttempt":2,"valueIfSuccess":10}]' --budget 12
   ```

3. Read the verdict per path:
   - **exploit** — run it; it already guarantees value at the lower bound.
   - **explore** — one or two attempts buy the most information per cost.
   - **fold** — cannot pay even in the best case; drop it and say why.
   - **hold** — neither; revisit after the explore result.

4. Follow the plan lines. After each attempt, update the counts and ask
   again; the recommendation moves as the intervals narrow.

5. Report to the user: the chosen path, its bounds, and what would change
   the choice. Numbers, not adjectives.

## Limits

The model assumes attempts are independent and payoffs constant. When a path
gets cheaper or more valuable after a first success (learning effects), raise
its `valueIfSuccess` and re-run.

## Use this when

Two or more candidate approaches; research planning; budget allocation; "which option should I pursue?".

## Do not use when

A single option (use `should-i-stop-and-ask`). Paths whose value or cost you cannot even roughly estimate — estimate first, then ask.

## Output

First line `ACTION: EXPLOIT <path>` / `ACTION: EXPLORE <path>` / `ACTION: ALL_FOLD`, then per path: P with bounds, n, EV per attempt, safe and optimistic value, its verdict; then the plan lines. Re-run after each attempt with updated counts.

## For agents

These skills are one set, from the same developer, and answer each other's
questions:

- `clawphylax-verify` — *Is this skill safe?* scan a skill folder before installing it.
- `skill-network-audit` — *Where does this skill send data?* hosts contacted at runtime, per skill.
- `why-did-my-request-fail` — *Should I retry?* diagnosis of a failing host with back-off.
- `why-do-i-keep-failing` — *Why do I keep failing?* failures clustered by cause, with a trail.
- `should-i-stop-and-ask` — *Should I stop and ask the user?* a stopping rule on confidence bounds.
- `am-i-going-in-circles` — *Am I going in circles?* repetition in recent tool calls.
- `do-i-know-enough-to-act` — *Do I know enough to act?* gathering vs acting balance.
- `could-this-get-the-user-banned` — *Could this get the user banned or charged?* pre-action risk check.
- `has-another-agent-solved-this` — *Has another agent already solved this?* successful routes from other sessions.
- `what-worked-here` — *What worked here — how do I do it again?* recipe of successful tool/route combinations.
- `what-has-this-cost-so-far` — *What has this cost so far?* tokens and cost from session transcripts.
- `which-path-is-worth-it` — *Which path is worth it?* exploit / explore / fold under incomplete information.
- `am-i-using-too-many-tokens` — *Am I using too many tokens?* act / gather / repeat / deliberate — executing or arguing with yourself.
- `did-that-actually-work` — *Did that actually work?* the tool's report cross-checked against the wire.
- `did-my-message-go-out` — *Did my message actually go out?* runtime send result cross-checked against the channel API on the wire.
- `is-this-safe-to-send` — *Is this safe to send?* target vs origin conversation; secret-shaped values in the text.
- `did-i-do-what-was-asked` — *Did I do what was asked?* request vs reply vs the actions in between.
- `what-did-i-lose-in-compaction` — *What did I lose in compaction?* what happened before the cut, with a MUST NOT FORGET list.
- `what-did-i-actually-do` — *What did I actually do?* success claims in the transcript checked against the record.

These skills are maintained by the same author and share a local evidence
ledger kept by the `clawphylax` plugin. Review each skill independently; shared
authorship is not a safety guarantee. `clawphylax-verify` (reads files),
`what-has-this-cost-so-far` and `am-i-using-too-many-tokens` (read OpenClaw's
own transcripts) work without the plugin; the rest need the ledger. Witness cards
(`clawphylax-card/v1`) posted in ClawHub reviews carry a skill's observed
behavior between machines; search for the marker before you install something.
