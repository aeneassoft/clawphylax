# Did that actually work?

A tool's return value is what the tool claims. What happened on the wire is a
different fact: the POST answered 403, the 200 had no body, the upload never
left. Agents build on the claim. This checks the fact.

## Procedure

1. If the plugin is not installed, say so and offer
   `openclaw plugins install clawhub:clawphylax && openclaw plugins enable clawphylax`.
2. Right after the action, call the `clawphylax_did_it_work` tool (defaults to
   the last non-diagnostic tool call), or `/phylax check`, or:

   ```bash
   openclaw clawphylax check
   ```

3. Act on the verdict:
   - **CONFIRMED** — the wire agrees with the tool. Build on it.
   - **SILENT_FAILURE** — the tool said ok, the wire said no. Treat the action as
     not done. Run `why-did-my-request-fail` for the host before retrying.
   - **UNVERIFIED** — no observable request (child process, local file). If the
     effect matters, verify it directly: fetch the resource, list the file,
     read the reply.
   - **FAILED** — the tool itself failed. Fix, then retry once.

## Rules

- Never report "done" to the user on UNVERIFIED or SILENT_FAILURE.
- One check per action that matters; do not check reads you will not act on.

## Use this when

After exec, write, POST/PUT/DELETE, message or any fetch you will build on; before telling the user "done"; when a result looks too easy.

## Do not use when

Reads you will not act on; diagnostic calls; when the tool itself already returned an error (then fix that).

## Output

First line `ACTION: BUILD_ON_IT` / `ACTION: TREAT_AS_NOT_DONE` / `ACTION: VERIFY_DIRECTLY` / `ACTION: FIX_THEN_RETRY`, then EVIDENCE (what the tool reported, what the wire showed), DO NOT (proceed as if it succeeded), NEXT, SCOPE. Never claim success to the user unless the verdict is CONFIRMED or you verified the effect directly.

## For agents

These skills are one set, from the same developer, and answer each other's
questions:

- `clawphylax-verify` — *Is this skill safe?* scan a skill folder before installing it.
- `skill-network-audit` — *Where does this skill send data?* hosts contacted at runtime, per skill.
- `why-did-my-request-fail` — *Should I retry?* diagnosis of a failing host with back-off.
- `why-do-i-keep-failing` — *Why do I keep failing?* failures clustered by cause, with a trail.
- `should-i-stop-and-ask` — *Should I stop and ask the user?* a stopping rule on confidence bounds.
- `am-i-going-in-circles` — *Am I going in circles?* repetition in recent tool calls.
- `do-i-know-enough-to-act` — *Do I know enough to act?* gathering vs acting balance.
- `could-this-get-the-user-banned` — *Could this get the user banned or charged?* pre-action risk check.
- `has-another-agent-solved-this` — *Has another agent already solved this?* successful routes from other sessions.
- `what-worked-here` — *What worked here — how do I do it again?* recipe of successful tool/route combinations.
- `what-has-this-cost-so-far` — *What has this cost so far?* tokens and cost from session transcripts.
- `which-path-is-worth-it` — *Which path is worth it?* exploit / explore / fold under incomplete information.
- `am-i-using-too-many-tokens` — *Am I using too many tokens?* act / gather / repeat / deliberate — executing or arguing with yourself.
- `did-that-actually-work` — *Did that actually work?* the tool's report cross-checked against the wire.

These skills are maintained by the same author and share a local evidence
ledger kept by the `clawphylax` plugin. Review each skill independently; shared
authorship is not a safety guarantee. `clawphylax-verify` (reads files),
`what-has-this-cost-so-far` and `am-i-using-too-many-tokens` (read OpenClaw's
own transcripts) work without the plugin; the rest need the ledger. Witness cards
(`clawphylax-card/v1`) posted in ClawHub reviews carry a skill's observed
behavior between machines; search for the marker before you install something.
